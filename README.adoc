== Abstract
This guide leverages the syntax conventions from the `ER Assistant v2.10` tool, developed by jukicn@acm.org, to create Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) using PlantUML. Adopting these conventions, can produce clear and consistent ERD that are easy to understand and maintain. The current guide provides detailed instructions, examples, and best practices for defining entities, relationships, cardinality, and attributes in/for PlantUML.

== Syntax for PlantUML

=== Entities

Supertype and subtype entities::
* If the entity is a supertype it will be denoted with the relationship line thickness of 2.
** It can be a `-->` or a `--|>` depending on the type of supertype.
** The parameter `skinparam groupInheritance 2` can be used to start join from 2 instead of the default.
But once it's joined, the thickness will be ignored.
* Supertype entities will be inside a rectangle indicating the family of for its subtypes (optional).
* If the supertype entity has the property of being 'disjoint' (`D`) or 'complete' (`C`),
it will be marked over the entity name as `DC` for both or just the single character for each (stereotypes).

NOTE: The `skinparam groupInheritance 2` parameter doesn't work with `-->`.
And if the `skinparam groupInheritance 2` parameter is used, the thickness attribute will be ignored.

Weak entities::
If the entity is a weak entity, it will be marked with a `#line.dashed` after the entity name, so it gets a dashed line border.

Regular entities::
If the entity is a regular entity, it won't have any special markings.

Comments::

.Example of entities
[plantuml]
----
@startuml ERD
left to right direction
skinparam groupInheritance 2

rectangle "Supertype family" as superfamily {
  entity "Entity 1 (Supertype and Regular)" as entity1 <<DC>>
  entity "Entity 5 (Subtype)" as entity5
  entity "Entity 6 (Subtype)" as entity6
  entity "Entity 2 (Supertype and Weak)" as entity2 #line.dashed
  note bottom: Note for the entity 2.
}
note right of superfamily: Note for the supertype family.
' note <direction of entity>: <text> '

entity "Entity 3 (Not Supertype and Regular )" as entity3
entity "Entity 4 (Not Supertype and Weak)" as entity4 #line.dashed

entity1 <|-- entity5
entity1 <|-- entity6

=== Attributes

Primary key::
The primary key will be separated from the rest.

Allow null::
If the attribute allows null values, it won't have any special markings.
Otherwise it will have an asterisk `*` before the attribute name.

Foreign key::
If the attribute is a foreign key, it will be bolded.

Comments::
https://plantuml.com/class-diagram#c909b0b5f0434a64[Link to class diagram filed notes], these to be for the attributes.

.Example of attributes
[plantuml]
----
@startuml ERD
' left to right direction

entity "Person" as person {
  int id
  ==
  * string name
  date birthdate
  * string email
}
note right of person::name
  This is the name of the person
end note

entity "Address" as address {
  int id
  ==
  * string street
  * string city
  * string state
  * string country
  * string postal_code
  --
  * **int person_id**
}
note left of address::person_id
  This is the foreign key to the person -- address
end note

person -- address

=== Relationships & Cardinality

https://plantuml.com/ie-diagram#a33822c778959028[Link to the extension of class diagrams] in PlantUML for the relationships cardinality.

Regular::
Denoted with dotted lines.

Identifying::
Denoted with regular lines.

Relationship Attributes::
Use an intermediate entity to represent the relationship with attributes.

Customer }|..o{ Order : places
Student }o..o{ Course : enrolls in
Employee ||--|| "Employee Detail" : has details
Department |o--o{ Employee : manages

' Entities
entity Customer {

}

entity Product {
    * product_id: int

' Intermediate entity representing the relationship with attributes
entity Order {
    * order_id: int
    customer_id: int <<FK>>
    product_id: int <<FK>>

}

=== Diagram Notes

For diagram notes, simply use floating notes as given https://plantuml.com/class-diagram#59c91a18bcc97bb0[here].

.Example of diagram notes
[plantuml]
----
@startuml
class Object << general >>
Object <|--- ArrayList

note top of Object : In java, every class\nextends this one.

note "This is a floating note" as N1
note "This note is connected\nto several objects." as N2
Object .. N2
N2 .. ArrayList

class Foo
note left: On last defined class

=== Design Justification

For design justifications, I really couldn't find a workaround but just to keep using notes or using adding them directly into the report.
